cd means change directory. This changes which directory is the current directory, but the specific result depends on the argument:
cd x moves in one level: it looks in the current directory for the directory named x and makes it the current directory.
cd .. moves out one level: it finds the directory that contains the current directory, then makes that directory the current directory.
cd / switches the current directory to the outermost directory, /.
ls means list. It prints out all of the files and directories immediately contained by the current directory:
123 abc means that the current directory contains a file named abc with size 123.
dir xyz means that the current directory contains a directory named xyz.
